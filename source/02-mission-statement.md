# Mission Statement

At Cloudogu we are passionate software craftsmen. We are driven by quality, efficiency and fun. We build our software by utilizing TDD, Clean Code, CI/CD and containerization in an agile and collaborative environment. We believe in the power and freedom of the open source community and pledge to make our contribution. We encourage businesses to use open source development tools and provide enterprise level security, operations and support for them. Our mission is to provide a best of breed environment both for the community and the enterprise.

This is why we created the *Cloudogu EcoSystem* â€“ an open platform that lets the community thrive and businesses grow.
